# Going to buy a new laptop or OS?
 ### This advice is too simple to confuse you


*Hello! This is a quick blogpost about whether you should purchase windows, MacOS
or Linux.*

__ My name is Karan Lala, and I will now tell you what I know.__
*Disclaimer: I know not much, **beware**.*


 Windows:
 This is what I've used, almost always, and what most people have. Most of the
 masses, at least.
 Windows is widely used, but is demanding on hardware. It's great for day to
 day tasks, presentations, and similar stuff. Windows also has constant updates,
 which are usually useful. Most games run on windows- The gaming community
 modifies their machines' hardware as well, and windows has a lot of software's
 developed for a variety of operations.

 Windows is however, susceptible to viruses, trojan horses, you name it.
 Antivirus software has gotten better though and as long as you're careful
 with your downloads, you should be fine.
 Buying windows 10 will you set you back about $120.

Mac:
Considered "elite", by many, Mac OS X, or OS X runs on Macs, made by Apple.
While you can download whatever version of windows you want on your machine,
you can't just download OS X off the web. The way to obtain it is to buy an
apple product- The web tells me there is a way to run OS X by downloading it
somehow, but it sounds like more trouble than its worth.

You probably won't catch a virus here, but nor is the software tinker friendly
at all. There are quite a few applications, though not as many as for windows,
and you're much better of gaming on Windows than on a Mac. However, Mac is still
preferred for purposes like coding, multimedia creation and editing etc.
It's also sleeker(generally), more stylish and comes equipped with a longer
lasting battery.
Cost?
>As an Apple genius would say,
>"Just buy a Mac".

Linux:
*This will be a list, cause why not?*

1. Linux is a younger player than the other two, and very customizable. So, many
people did customize it; and now there a HUGE number of versions floating
around, and you can probably find one you like and download it.

2. One typically buys a windows computer and reformats the hard drive to use
Linux.

3. Linux is free, and very powerful, but also requires knowledge about this
stuff.

4. It's popularity is growing as using computers and being able to code is
becoming
more and more essential.

In the end, the right choice for most people ( Because of how computers are
popularly used) seems to be Windows. Hope this post helped you a teensy bit,
have fun geeking!
