# Going to buy a new laptop or OS?
 ### This post offers a quick overview that might help make the right decision.


*Hello! This is a quick blogpost about whether you should purchase windows, MacOS or Linux- the three main choices.*

My name is Karan Lala, and this is my email for any further questions:

*Disclaimer: I am not an expert on this.*


 #### Windows:
 This is what I've used, almost always, and what most people have. Most of the
 masses, at least.
 Windows is widely used, but is demanding on hardware. It's great for day to
 day tasks, presentations, and similar stuff. Windows also has constant updates,
 which are usually useful. Most games run on windows- The gaming community
 modifies their machines' hardware as well, and windows has a lot of software's
 developed for a variety of operations. Windows has a variety of different
 graphics cards that can be used, while Macs are very restrictive in that regard.
 The number of applications and programs made for Windows are gigantic, which
 is an advantage.
 Earlier, a popular opinion was that newer windows versions have many bugs.
 While new versions still have some bugs, the number has reduced, and the
 newer versions have more functionality and lesser issues.
 For you if:
 * You don't mind mild maintenance


 Windows is however, susceptible to viruses, trojan horses, you name it.
 Antivirus software has gotten better though and as long as you're careful
 with your downloads, you should be fine.
 Buying windows 10 will you set you back about $120.
 Windows was not built on UNIX, like Linux or Mac, but on NT, introduced by
 Microsoft in 1993. Windows machines typically also come with "bloatware"
 installed, which are mostly third party applications that may or may not be
 useful but are inbuilt.



#### Mac:
Considered "elite", by many, Mac OS X, or OS X runs on Macs, made by Apple.
While you can download whatever version of windows you want on your machine,
you can't just download OS X off the web. The way to obtain it is to buy an
apple product- The web will tell you there is a way to run OS X by downloading it
somehow, but it sounds like more trouble than it's worth.
Another factor drawing people to Macs is the whole Apple platform. The most
seamless integration and experience is offered by Apple, and the easiest way
to obtain it is by purchasing all Apple devices- Meaning an Apple phone, laptop,
watch etc.
Apple concentrates its efforts on fewer products and obtains greater refinement.


You probably won't catch a virus here, but nor is the software tinker friendly
at all. There are quite a few applications, though not as many as for windows,
and you're much better of gaming on Windows than on a Mac. However, Mac is still
preferred for purposes like coding, multimedia creation and editing etc.
It's also sleeker(generally), more stylish and comes equipped with a longer
lasting battery.
Cost? An Apple laptop, let's say about $1000 at least.
>As an Apple genius might say,
>"Just buy a Mac, it's the best".

#### Linux:
*This will be a list, cause why not?*

1. Linux is a younger player than the other two, and very customizable. So, many
people did customize it; and now there a __HUGE__ number of versions floating
around, and you can probably find one you like and download it.

2. One typically buys a windows computer and reformats the hard drive to use
Linux.

3. Linux is free, and very powerful, but also requires knowledge about this
stuff.

4. It's popularity is growing as using computers and being able to code is
becoming
more and more essential.

Linux was first released by Linus Torvald in 1991. The new ChromeOS is also
based on Linux. The Linux source code can be used, modified both commercially
and non-commercially, and is truly an open source operating system. Its 
free, but requires technical knowledge, so you're spending time here.

In the end, the right choice for most people ( Because of how computers are
popularly used) seems to be Windows. However, depending on needs and
preferences one should definitely do solid research before making a purchase.
 Hope this post helped you a teensy bit,
